# CLAUDE.md

Instructions for Claude Code working on the ooxml project.

## Project Overview

High-quality Rust library for reading/writing Office Open XML formats (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX).

See `SPEC.md` for the full specification and roadmap.

## Architecture

```
crates/
  ooxml/          # Core: OPC packaging, relationships, content types
  ooxml-wml/      # WordprocessingML (Word documents)
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Typed over stringly** - Every XML element should have a Rust struct
2. **Roundtrip preservation** - Unknown/unsupported elements must be preserved
3. **Lazy when possible** - Don't parse everything upfront
4. **Spec-driven** - ECMA-376 is the source of truth

## Development

```bash
cargo test          # Run tests
cargo clippy        # Lint
cargo doc --open    # View docs
```

## Current Priority

v0.1 goal: Basic Word document support
1. OPC packaging (ZIP read/write, relationships)
2. Document structure (body, paragraphs, runs)
3. Basic formatting (bold, italic, underline)
4. Styles (read style definitions, apply to content)
5. Tables (basic)
6. Images (embedded)

## Workflow

**Batch cargo commands** to minimize round-trips:
```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings && cargo test
```
After editing multiple files, run the full check once — not after each edit. Formatting is handled automatically by the pre-commit hook (`cargo fmt`).

**When making the same change across multiple crates**, edit all files first, then build once.

**Use `normalize view` for structural exploration:**
```bash
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <file>    # outline with line numbers
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <dir>     # directory structure
```

## Commit Convention

Use conventional commits: `type(scope): message`

Types:
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `refactor` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `chore` - Maintenance (deps, CI, etc.)
- `test` - Adding or updating tests

Scope is optional but recommended (e.g., `wml`, `corpus`, `packaging`).

## Code Conventions

**Error handling:**
- Use `thiserror` for error enums
- Each crate has its own `Error` and `Result` type
- Wrap external errors with `#[from]` where appropriate
- Use `Invalid(String)` for malformed input, `Unsupported(String)` for unimplemented features

**Naming:**
- Struct names match OOXML element names where practical (e.g., `Run` for `<w:r>`)
- Use full words, not abbreviations (except where OOXML itself abbreviates)
- Prefix internal modules with the crate's domain (`wml_`, `sml_`, etc.) only if disambiguation needed

**XML handling:**
- Use `quick-xml` for parsing and serialization
- Preserve unknown elements/attributes in a catch-all field for roundtrip fidelity
- Namespaces: define constants for common OOXML namespaces (see ECMA-376 Part 1, §8)

**Serialization patterns:**
- Enums that map to XML values should have a `to_xml_value()` method
- Avoid inline match expressions when converting enums to XML strings
- Keep serialization logic close to the type definition, not scattered in writer code

**Dependencies:**
- Workspace dependencies in root `Cargo.toml`
- Internal crates use `{ workspace = true }`

## Testing Strategy

**Goal: every feature exercised by a fixture, every fixture validated by a roundtrip test.**

Layers (in order of scope):
1. **XML unit tests** — individual element parse/serialize, no full document. SML has these in `crates/ooxml-sml/tests/fixtures/xml/`. WML and PML need the same.
2. **Fixture roundtrip tests** — `ooxml-fixtures` generates 178 CC0 `.docx`/`.xlsx`/`.pptx` files with typed JSON manifests. Each reader crate should have a test that reads every fixture and asserts all manifest assertions pass.
3. **Structural edge cases** — nested tables, mixed content, unusual-but-valid constructions. These live in the fixture crate alongside the standard fixtures.
4. **Malformed/adversarial tests** — truncated ZIP, missing parts, broken XML, unknown namespaces. These live in each crate's `tests/` as `Result::is_err()` assertions. Do NOT put these in the fixture crate (they're not CC0-distributable examples).
5. **Corpus tests** — parse large real-world corpora and assert >95% success rate. Marked `#[ignore]` since the corpus is not vendored.

**NapierOne corpus:** Available locally at `corpora/napierone/` but cannot be vendored due to licensing. Corpus tests are `#[ignore]`'d and require the corpus to be present. SML and PML have corpus tests; WML needs one.

**Fixture coverage checklist** — these categories must each have at least one fixture:
- WML: text formatting, paragraphs, lists, tables, headers/footers, images, hyperlinks, comments, footnotes, endnotes, track changes, field codes (TOC), forms, math (all OMML operators), bookmarks, text boxes, nested tables
- SML: cell values/types, formulas, number formats, font/fill/border styling, layout (freeze/autofilter), merges, hyperlinks, data validation, conditional formatting, multiple sheets, comments, protection
- PML: shapes (all types), connectors, groups, text formatting, tables, images, hyperlinks, animations, transitions, notes, master/layout, charts

## Consumer

This library will be used by `rescribe` (document conversion library) for DOCX support.
The rescribe team is waiting on this to implement `rescribe-read-docx` and `rescribe-write-docx`.

## Code Rules

- **Reference the spec** - When implementing OOXML elements, cite the relevant ECMA-376 section
- **Test as you go** - Every new struct/parser needs a unit test
- **Preserve unknown data** - Never silently drop XML elements or attributes we don't understand
- **Verify roundtrips** - Changes to serialization must pass roundtrip tests

## Generated Files — IMPORTANT

Generated files (`generated.rs`, `generated_parsers.rs`, `generated_serializers.rs`) are **committed to the repo** so that users can build without the ECMA-376 RNC schemas in `/spec/`.

**When you change `ooxml-codegen`, you MUST regenerate ALL crates and commit the results.** The codegen is shared — a change to `codegen.rs`, `parser_gen.rs`, or `serializer_gen.rs` affects every crate's generated output. Stale generated files will silently diverge from the codegen and cause confusing bugs later.

```bash
# Regenerate everything (requires schemas in /spec/)
OOXML_REGENERATE=1 OOXML_GENERATE_PARSERS=1 OOXML_GENERATE_SERIALIZERS=1 \
  cargo build -p ooxml-wml -p ooxml-sml -p ooxml-pml -p ooxml-dml
```

After regenerating, commit all changed `generated*.rs` files in the same commit (or immediately after) the codegen change.

## Codegen Conventions

**Feature YAML (`spec/ooxml-features.yaml`):**
- Type keys use codegen-output names (PascalCase), NOT spec names with underscores: `CTPPrBase:` not `CT_PPrBase:`
- Types with name mappings in `ooxml-names.yaml` use the mapped name (`Paragraph`, `Compatibility`)
- `"*": [feature]` wildcard gates all fields of a type under one feature
- When adding a new feature gate, build with `--no-default-features` to catch handwritten code that references gated fields

**Name mapping rules (all ~1100 types mapped; `warn_unmapped: true` enforced):**
- ST_ enums keep clean names; CT_ element wrappers conflicting with an ST_ alias get an `Element` suffix (e.g. `OnOffElement`, `HpsMeasureElement`)
- `ST_String: XmlString` to avoid a `pub type String = String` cycle

**Cross-crate feature flags:** when a crate method requires a feature from a dependency crate, re-export it (e.g. PML's Cargo.toml: `dml-fills = ["ooxml-dml/dml-fills"]`). DML default features are always available to dependents; PML's `pml-*` flags are PML-only.

**Build.rs analysis output:** `OOXML_ANALYZE=1` writes through `eprintln!` in build.rs — only visible with `cargo build -vv` or after touching build.rs to force a rerun.

## Module Layout (SML)

`workbook.rs` imports from `ext.rs`. Extension traits on generated types that need workbook-level context (e.g. `StylesheetExt`, `DefinedNameExt`) live in `workbook.rs`, not `ext.rs`, to avoid a circular dep.

## Generated Type Gotchas

- `STCoordinate` is a `String` (not `i64`) — `.parse::<i64>()` for numeric access. DML/PML offsets: `transform.offset.{x,y}.parse::<i64>()`. Extents (`STPositiveCoordinate`) are `i64` directly. Rotation (`STAngle`) is `i32`; degrees = `rot as f64 / 60000.0`.
- SML `BooleanProperty` access: `.field.as_ref().is_some_and(|v| v.value.unwrap_or(false))`
- Moving a field out of a `Box<T>`: bind first (`let inner = *boxed; inner.field`) — can't partially move from a live box.
- `types::DefinedName.text` holds the formula/reference (`.reference` is a `Vec<RichTextElement>`).

## Static Analysis for Config Files

The codegen includes static analysis to detect unmapped types and fields in `ooxml-names.yaml` and `ooxml-features.yaml`. Run during regeneration:

```bash
OOXML_ANALYZE=1 OOXML_REGENERATE=1 cargo build -p ooxml-wml -p ooxml-sml -p ooxml-pml -p ooxml-dml
```

This reports:
- **Unmapped types**: Types in schema without name mappings (will use default PascalCase naming)
- **Unmapped fields**: Fields in schema without feature mappings (will always be included)

**Goal**: Once all types/fields are mapped, enable `warn_unmapped: true` in `CodegenConfig` to fail builds on new unmapped items. This ensures config files stay in sync with schema changes.

## Hard Constraints

Do not:
- Parse entire documents eagerly - use lazy loading for large files
- Invent element names - use OOXML terminology from ECMA-376
- Panic on malformed input - return `Error::Invalid` instead
- Add format-specific code to `ooxml` core - that belongs in `ooxml-wml`, etc.
- Commit without running `cargo clippy` and `cargo test`
- Use interactive git commands (`git add -p`, `git add -i`, `git rebase -i`) — these block on stdin and hang in non-interactive shells; stage files by name instead

## Ecosystem Design Principles

Cross-cutting principles distilled from the ecosystem's own decisions (synthesized in `docs/decisions/throughlines.md`). Apply them when building new repos and recording decisions. (Already-encoded principles — independent-tools / no-path-deps, the delegation model, CLAUDE.md-as-control-surface — live in their own sections and are not repeated here.)

- **Prefer data over code at every seam.** Serializable AST / struct / JSON over closures, embedded DSLs, or source text — so artifacts cache, replay, transport, and diff.
- **Library-first; projection-from-one-definition.** The typed library is the source of truth; CLI / HTTP / MCP / WebSocket / JSON surfaces are generated projections, never hand-rolled per surface.
- **Capability security.** Hosts grant pre-opened handles; code only attenuates what it is given; nothing forges authority; allow-list over deny-list.
- **The LLM is an oracle at the leaves, never the control loop.** Determinism is a hard invariant: seeded RNG, event-log replay, build-time-only inference. Per-query LLM in the hot loop is a defect.
- **Trust comes from verifiable evidence, not authority.** Verbatim snippets, pinned-commit permalinks, claim→node citation — never a bare reference.
- **Retire, don't deprecate; collapse asymmetries to primitives.** Remove backward-compat aliases rather than carry them; reduce N special cases to their irreducible primitives.
- **Validate against reality; tests are the spec.** Load-bearing substrates are validated against real corpora; fixtures and tests define correctness, not aspirational specs.

## Hard Constraints

- No `--no-verify`. Fix the issue or fix the hook.
- No path dependencies in `Cargo.toml` — they couple repos and break independent publishing.
- No interactive git (no `git rebase -i`, no `git add -i`, no `--no-edit` on rebase).
- No suggesting project names. LLMs are bad at this; refine the conceptual space only.
- No tracking cross-project issues in conversation — they go in TODO.md in the affected repo.
- No ecosystem changes without checking all affected repos.
- No assuming a tool is missing without checking `nix develop`.
- Commit completed work in the same turn it finishes. Uncommitted work is lost work.

## Meta

- Something unexpected is a signal. Stop and find out why. Do not accept the anomaly and proceed.
- Corrections from the user are conversation, not material for new rules. Rules are added when a failure mode is observed repeatedly.
